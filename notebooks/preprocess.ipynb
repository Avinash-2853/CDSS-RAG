    "This notebook loads the first 1,000 rows from `medical_data.csv`, `patient_notes.csv`, `PMC-Patients.csv`, and `pubmed_dataset.csv`, cleans and de-identifies every note, merges all text into a single master document, and stores both the full document and LangChain-tokenised passages inside a Chroma vector database backed by BioClinicalBERT embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow outline:\n",
    "1. **Cleaning & Normalisation** – remove noise/special symbols, expand UMLS-style medical abbreviations, lowercase, and redact PHI markers for HIPAA/GDPR compliance.\n",
    "2. **LangChain Tokenisation & BioClinicalBERT Embeddings** – build a master document, measure token counts with a Hugging Face tokenizer, and prepare embeddings with a PubMed/BioBERT-family model.\n",
    "3. **Chunking & ChromaDB Storage** – split the master document into ~100–300 word passages using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, then insert both the full document and the chunks into a Chroma collection (metadata includes source, chunk index, timestamps).\n",
    "4. **Final Outputs** – persist the cleaned corpus, chunk metadata, Chroma persistence directory, and demonstrate a sample semantic query for RAG readiness.\n",

      "a 20-year-old male presented with worsening bloody diarrhea of 4 months' duration associated with cramping abdominal pain and weight loss of 4 kg. on admission, he was hemodynamically stable. physical examination showed mild tenderness to deep palpation in the left lower quadrant. laboratory tests were consistent with anemia  hemoglobin   10.5 mg/dl, hematocrit   33.5% , thrombocytosis  platelets   568000/mm3 , low iron level  iron   25mg/dl , and normal c-reactive protein  crp . stool analysis, ova and parasite test, clostridium difficile toxin assay, and stool culture were negative. colonoscopy revealed left-sided colitis with marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, and friability erosions  mayo score 2 . biopsies showed chronic active colitis consistent with uc. based on the clinical presentation and laboratory, endoscopic, and pathologic findings, the patient was diagnosed with moderate left-sided uc and was started on oral and topical 5-aminosalicylic acid  5-asa  without any response to treatment: bloody diarrhea  more than 5 bowel movement per day , severe abdominal pain, low grade fever, and additional weight loss in addition to severe anemia  hemoglobin   7.3g/dl  and high crp with negative stool tests. high dose steroids therapy was started with marked improvement. steroid tapering caused recurrence of symptoms and anemia at 20mg prednisone per day. relying on the findings above, the patient had left-sided uc and is steroid-dependent, so infliximab 5mg/kg was initiated at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks without any improvement after 4 months of treatment with persistent bloody diarrhea and severe iron deficiency anemia. repeated colonoscopy showed severe inflammatory mucosa with deep ulcerations and pseudopolyps formation at the splenic flexure and the distal part of the left colon, separated by healed mucosa. biopsies from the pathologic area revealed severe chronic active colitis consistent with inflammatory bowel disease/uc without any evidence of cytomegalovirus inclusions. given the lack of response to infliximab and the worsening endoscopic findings, resistance to therapy was suspected. additional laboratory tests showed low infliximab through level with high antibodies level to infliximab. the patient was switched to combination therapy with adalimumab 160mg at week 0, 80mg at week 2, and 40mg every other week plus azathioprine 2.5mg/kg with only partial response: improvement of diarrhea but persistence of severe nocturnal colicky abdominal pain. adalimumab trough level was very low with the absence of anti-drug antibodies. so, adalimumab was increased to 40mg per week. two months later, he continued to have severe colicky abdominal pain and distension with weight loss. new colonoscopy revealed complete mucosal healing and a giant pseudopolyp in the left colon and another obstructive one at the level of the splenic flexure  figures and  . biopsies were consistent with chronic inflammation with architectural distortion and\n",

      "we present the case of a 42-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with a complaint of abdominal pain and diarrhea for 3 days. the abdominal pain started in the periumbilical region and was shifted to the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. the pain started gradually and had been progressing in severity. he described the pain as a stabbing in nature. it was exacerbated by movement and food intake. the pain was partially relieved by oral analgesic medications like paracetamol. the pain was associated with low-grade fever and decreased appetite. the patient also complained of diarrhea with five bowel motions/day. the stools were watery with no mucus or blood. he reported that diarrhea developed after he received an oral antibiotic therapy  cefuroxime  for a recent upper respiratory tract infection. nthe past medical history of the patient was remarkable for diabetes mellitus that was well-controlled with oral antidiabetic agents. he did not undergo any previous abdominal surgeries. he had a smoking history of 15 pack-years. he had never drunk alcohol before. he worked as a taxi driver. the family history was unremarkable for any inherited gastrointestinal disorders. nupon examination, the patient appeared sick. he was not pale, jaundiced, or cyanosed. vital signs revealed tachycardia  115 bpm , low-grade fever  37.5  , normal respiratory rate  14 bpm , and maintained blood pressure  122/80 mmhg . the oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. abdominal examination revealed a soft abdomen with diffuse tenderness. however, the tenderness was more pronounced in the right iliac fossa with a positive rebound sign. further, the rovsing sign was positive. initial laboratory investigation revealed elevated leukocyte count and elevated inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein. the renal and hepatic profiles were within the normal limits  table  . nin light of the aforementioned clinical information, the patient was diagnosed as having acute appendicitis. a ct scan with intravenous contrast was performed to confirm the diagnosis. the scan demonstrated colonic wall thickening with edematous haustral folds suggestive of pseudomembranous colitis. further, an endoluminal lesion was observed in the cecum with an average size of 6 cm. the lesion was well-defined and had a homogenous fat density with no solid component. the mass was causing a partial colonic obstruction. such findings conferred the diagnosis of cecal lipoma  figure  . nthe patient was prepared for an emergency laparoscopy for further evaluation and management. the operation was done under general anesthesia and the patient was placed in the supine position. limited segmental rection of the cecum with appendectomy was performed. the estimated blood loss was 10 ml and the total operative time was 100 minutes. the patient tolerated the operation with no complications. he had an uneventful recovery. histopathological examination of the resected\n",
